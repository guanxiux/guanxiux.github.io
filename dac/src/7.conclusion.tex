\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic perspective that models the evolution of AI model in robotic online training tasks and its influence on the information gain estimation of a navigation path with loss dynamics.
And we propose LOss-Dynamics-Aware multi-agent cooperative active sampling system for robotic online training (LODA).
Using the Loss Prediction Module and the Recursive Path Planning algorithm of LODA, we manage to model the accumulated information gain along each step of a navigation path and find the most informative path for the training AI model, which accelerates the increase of its performance.
LODA will nurture the development of more real-world robotic online training applications and improving their performance by enabling efficient and high performance automatic high quality training data acquisition.
