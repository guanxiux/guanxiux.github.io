\begin{abstract}
  Online training tasks deployed over mobile robots (robotic online training) have the potential to automatically collect high quality training data to improve the performance of their training Artificial Intelligence (AI) model.
  While active learning methods aim at finding the training data with highest quality, they fail to produce a navigation path with highest accumulated information gain for the online training tasks because they fail to model the evolution of the training AI model when new training data are collected along the navigation path.
  To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose LOss-Dynamics-Aware multi-agent cooperative active sampling system for robotic online training (LODA) that leverages a dynamic perspective of the training AI model that models the evolution of the training AI model and the corresponding information gain as the dynamics of loss value rendered to a sparse 3D grid corresponding to the environment.
  Using this representation, we are able to recursively predict the information gain of each step taken along a candidate path, and find the optimal path with highest accumulated information gain.
  Our system can also be easily extended to multiple robots by recursively predicting information gain from the planned path of other robots as an impact of the decision making of the local robot.
  Evaluation over different sizes of environments and different numbers of robots show at most 6.7\% higher final accuracy and 49.8\% less training time to reach a same high accuracy over the baselines.


  % Online training tasks rely on training input consecutively sampled from the real world to refine their training model, and automated mobile devices (robots) shouldering the responsibility of sampling has the potential to further enhance their training performance by actively sampling in reaction to the real-time training quality, besides saving human labor. However, to achieve such active sampling faces two major gaps. First, as the training quality is typically computation-intensive to get for a robot (e.g., validating), where to move for the robot to boost training performance? Second, since the consecutive samples from nearby states (e.g., position, orientation) of a robot are too similar and would limit the training information gain, how to move for better efficiency?

  % We observe that real-time training loss is spatially and temporally related to locations in the environment and implies the level of information gain on further sampling of these locations. The second gap can be overcome by cooperative multi-view sampling from multiple robots, since they are naturally distant in state space. Based on these observation, we choose to build an online training application named MIAS (Multi-robot Implicit Active SLAM) that drives multiple robots to actively and cooperatively sample the environment in real-time reaction to the quality of the training implicit SLAM model. Evaluation shows that MIAS with three robots speeds up the implicit SLAM tasks not only by up to xxX compared to the baselines with three robots, but also by xxX compared to MIAS with single robot.
