During the period under review, I researched the problem of robotic active sampling for online AI training tasks, so that the deployed online AI training tasks can achieve high performance with as little as possible training budget. I have developed a ROS system for robotic active sampling research with capability of distributed training. The key research question behind this problem is the continual estimation of information gain of robotic sampling action to the training task and we design a novel system to model such information gain with dynamics of loss records rendered over the environment.
While developing the above system on a 3D reconstruction task, a typical online training task, I also dived into a sub-problem: the next best view problem for 3D reconstruction where the information gain of samples from a fixed training dataset is considered. Inspired by loss space sharpness methods for active learning in classification tasks, I introduced loss space sharpness assessment to the information gain estimation for 3D reconstruction under the intuition that the observed image of an object has continuity when the viewpoint is slightly perturbed.
I have completed drafts and experiment prototypes for the above two projects.

I am planning to refine drafts and experiments of the above two projects and seek publishing them at top-tier system and AI conferences. I have submitted the draft of the second project to CVPR and am planning to submit the first project to DAC.
